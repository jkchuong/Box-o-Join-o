# Box-o-Join-o
This is a small Unity project that aims to develop my understanding of creating games using the Unity Engine.

The main objectives are as follows:
- To use tweening with [DoTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/) to create UI and object animations without using animator controllers.
- To use the new input system and allow player input from different sources.
- To create a simple online multiplayer game using [Photon Engine](https://www.photonengine.com/).
- To implement ScriptableObjects as a way of reducing dependencies and simplifying processes for designers to expand on.

Assets were used from [Kenny's Assets](https://kenney.nl/)
